I am building a desktop application called **Tailwind Studio** using Electron and Vue 3 that allows users to visually design Tailwind CSS-based web layouts. The app should provide a drag-and-drop interface for adding common layout components, a live preview of the design, and the ability to export the generated HTML and Tailwind classes.

I want to implement the following features:

- Canvas with WYSIWYG preview (HTML + Tailwind classes)
- Drag-and-drop basic layout components: Container, Row/Cols (grid/flex wrappers), Button, Text (heading/paragraph), Image, Form controls
- Right-side inspector to edit Tailwind classes + inline props (text, href, alt)
- Live responsive preview (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- Export code (HTML + Tailwind classes, option for React component output)
- Project save/load (JSON project file)
- Tailwind config import (basic) so exported classes match user's setup

**Application Name:**

```
Tailwind Studio
```

**Application Description**

```
The Tailwind Studio is a next-generation design and development tool that reimagines how developers create, customize, and collaborate on Tailwind-based user interfaces. Built for efficiency, precision, and innovation, it bridges the gap between visual creativity and production-ready code — empowering teams to move from idea to implementation faster than ever.

Whether you're prototyping a new layout, fine-tuning a component’s visual hierarchy, or exporting ready-to-use code for React, Vue, or Laravel, the Tailwind Studio makes the process simple, intelligent, and collaborative.
```

**Application Core Features**

- Canvas with WYSIWYG preview (HTML + Tailwind classes)
- Drag-and-drop basic layout components: Container, Row/Cols (grid/flex wrappers), Button, Text (heading/paragraph), Image, Form controls
- Right-side inspector to edit Tailwind classes + inline props (text, href, alt)
- Live responsive preview (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- Export code (HTML + Tailwind classes, option for React component output)
- Project save/load (JSON project file)
- Tailwind config import (basic) so exported classes match user's setup

**Application Future Features**

- AI-Assisted Component Generation: Users can describe a component in plain English (“Create a red notification badge with a bell icon and drop shadow”), and the system automatically builds the Tailwind markup. AI refines classes for performance, accessibility, and consistency.
- Smart Style Recommendations: The builder analyzes current color choices, spacing, and typography to suggest Tailwind-compatible improvements (e.g., better contrast ratios or consistent border radii). Accessibility audits integrated directly into the design process (AA/AAA compliance).
- Design-to-Code Sync: Import a Figma frame or design screenshot, and the system auto-generates Tailwind components that visually match it — drastically cutting frontend build time.
- Component Logic Layer: Go beyond visuals: add state-based variations (hover, focus, active, dark mode). Include optional React/Vue/Svelte snippets, making it easy to export components ready for any modern framework.
- Dynamic Preview Environment: A live preview that simulates real-world conditions — including network speed throttling, device emulation, and user interaction flows. Test how components behave under different scenarios. Real-time preview in both light and dark themes.
- One-Click Integration Export: Export directly to Next.js, Laravel Blade, or React components with proper imports. Optional PostCSS and Prettier formatting for clean, production-ready output.
- Versioned Component Presets: Save multiple component states or iterations. Built-in component versioning — great for teams testing variations in style or UX.
- Collaborative Workspace: Real-time multi-user editing with commenting and change tracking. Team members can share or lock specific components for review.
- Custom Tailwind Config Sync: Upload or link a project’s `tailwind.config.js` file to generate components using your exact theme, color palette, and breakpoints. Ensures perfect parity between design and production environments.
- Component Intelligence Index: The tool scores components on metrics like reusability, performance, and semantic accuracy, helping teams maintain design consistency at scale.
- Offline-Ready Progressive Web App (PWA): Fully functional offline, allowing developers to design and test components even without internet access.
- Plugin & Marketplace System: A public library where developers can publish and share their custom components or templates, similar to Tailwind UI but community-driven. Plugins to add animations, gradients, icons, or even integration with headless CMS components.
- Code & Design Dual View: Split-screen interface showing visual configuration on one side and editable Tailwind markup on the other — both synced in real-time.
- Component API Exporter: Automatically generate a JSON schema or API definition for your components, enabling external apps to consume your designs programmatically.
